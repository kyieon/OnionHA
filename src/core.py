    '''
    Onion HA is a simple way to add high availability to a cluster. In
    its latest version, Onion HA becomes more powerful, faster and
    reliable than ever, and can support an unlimited number of nodes.

    Configure the cluster according to your needs and run your own
    scripts when a node becomes active or passive.

    :type address: str
    :param address: The IP address or FQDN of the server. An IP address
        is preferred for a deterministic behavior.

    :type port: int
    :param port: The listening port of the cluster nodes, including
        this server.

    :type gateway: str
    :param gateway: The IP address or FQDN of the gateway. The gateway
        is used to check the connectivity of this node.

    :type init_delay: int
    :param init_delay: The delay before starting the server to ensure
        that the system services are operational (in seconds).

    :type deadtime: int
    :param deadtime: The delay before considering a node as dead (in
        seconds).

    :type node_addresses: list of str
    :param node_addresses: The IP address or FQDN of the nodes,
        including this node. The order of the nodes is important: in
        case of failure, their order is used to determine the new
        active node. The first node registered is the master node and
        is active by default.

    :type action_active: list of str
    :param action_active: The command or script to execute when this
        node becomes active.

    :type action_passive: list of str
    :param action_passive: The command or script to execute when this
        node becomes passive.
